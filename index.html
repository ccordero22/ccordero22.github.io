<h1>My Love</h1>
<h2>Carlos Cordero, 2019</h2>

<p>My angel,<br />
My sweetie,<br />
My goddess,<br />
My queen.</p>

<p>I took you for granted,<br />
I didn't see your worth.<br />
I played games with your mind,<br />
And i toyed with your heart.</p>

<p>I put up a front,<br />
I told myself we were just a fling.<br />
I told myself we didn't have a future.<br />
I made this my truth,<br />
I had to protect my heart,<br />
I had to keep my distance.</p>

<p>You come from a traditional Indian Muslim family.<br />
I come from humble Christian roots.<br />
You grew up with both parents.<br />
I grew up in a broken home.</p>

<p>Your father raised you with a firm hand.<br />
My father abandon me as an infant.<br />
You grew up priviledged.<br />
I grew up in poverty.</p>

<p>Despite all our differences,<br />
Despite all our struggles,<br />
We stand together, <br />
Side by side.</p>

<p>I love you more than i believed possible.<br />
I trust in you absolutely.<br />
You are my home.<br />
You are my future.<br />
You are my inspiration.<br />
You are my heart.</p>
